Think of a retailer that wants to go omni-channel - the ability to have seamless customer experience across multiple channels. For example, a customer may start an order online, go to the store, buy more items, pay for the entire transaction altogether. Some of the items will be supplied immediately and some will be shipped later. 


Try to come up with high level design for such a system .

Do not try to solve every detail. Focus on architecture principles and main components.
Feel free to take assumptions regarding usage pattern, client needs etc 
Output should be a diagram. White, doodle, or short presentation  - all work. 

Prepare to explain your solution and the reasoning behind it.


Good luck
