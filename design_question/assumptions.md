1. every customer can have only one open order at a time
2. the system will have an API for adding items or removing items from the customer's cart
3. we assume that for starting a RDBMS such as postgres will be able to contain and retrieve all of the data in a short period of time
4. once the customer closes the "deal" there should be a payment service which deals with the credit 
5. I don't know if it is required but I didn't deal with returns (customers might want to return a broken item)
